## A Note for the Judges

To simplify and enhance your testing experience for **Recode AI**, we have implemented the following:

1. **Convenient Testing Command**: You can quickly deploy the project using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This command will set up everything you need to run the project locally, minimizing setup time.

2. **Live Link**: <a href="https://recode-fz6oltg1b-satti-hari-krishna-reddys-projects.vercel.app" target="_blank">ðŸ”— Click here to view the live app</a>

3. **Demo**: A demo binary executable (.exe) is already included, allowing you to test it without needing to provide one. You can select the file in the UI to perform the test.

4. **Comprehensive Setup Instructions**: Detailed instructions on how to set up and test the project locally are included in the [Testing Instructions](#Testing-Instructions-for-the-Judges) section of this README. Please refer to it for a step-by-step guide.

By providing these features, we aim to make the testing process as smooth, efficient, and enjoyable as possible. Thank you for evaluating **Recode AI**!


# Recode AI: Turning Complexity Into Clarity

Recode AI is a decompilation and analysis tool designed for developers, educators, cybersecurity experts, and enthusiasts. It leverages powerful Azure services and Ghidra to provide seamless binary decompilation, AI insights, and multi-language translation, all within a scalable and cost-effective serverless architecture.

## Problem We Solved

Binary files often contain valuable information that developers and security analysts need to retrieve, analyze, or modify, but decompiled binary files are notoriously cryptic and difficult to interpret. Variables lack meaningful names, logic is convoluted, and understanding the code often feels like deciphering a foreign language. This complexity slows down even the most seasoned experts and creates a significant barrier for newcomers.

**Recode AI** revolutionizes this process by leveraging AI to produce human-readable, well-documented source code from raw binaries. Whether you're:
- Analyzing legacy systems
- Investigating malware
- Gaining insights into unknown software

Recode AI simplifies the process, making it accessible and efficient for everyone.

## Features
- **AI-Augmented Decompilation**: Converts cryptic decompiled binaries into clean, understandable source code enriched with AI-generated comments.
- **Multi-Language Translation**: Translate decompiled code into your preferred programming language.
- **Rapid Analysis**: Ideal for experts who want to enhance their speed and accuracy.
- **Beginner-Friendly Insights**: Provides context and clarity for those new to reverse engineering.

## Workflow

![Description of Image](/RecodeUi/public/recodeArch.png)

1. **Upload Your Binary**: Users upload .exe or .out files via the intuitive frontend.
2. **Trigger Serverless Azure Function**: The binary is stored in Azure Blob Storage.
3. **Run Ghidra in a Container**: Azure Container Instances (ACI) deploy a containerized Ghidra instance, paired with a lightweight Go server, to decompile the binary.
4. **AI Enhancements**: AI processes the decompiled code, generating meaningful variable names, logical structures, and comments.
5. **Retrieve Results**: The enriched source code is saved back to Azure Blob Storage and sent to the user.

## Why Azure?
- **Scalability**: Azure Container Instances (ACI) allow us to run Ghidra on demand, scaling automatically with workload.
- **Serverless Efficiency**: Azure Functions handle the workflow seamlessly, minimizing operational overhead and costs.
- **Integration**: Azure Blob Storage ensures secure, efficient file handling throughout the process.

By utilizing Azure to its fullest, Recode AI provides a cost-effective, high-performing, and scalable solution. The seamless integration of these services underscores the complexity and innovation behind our platform.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, Vite.
- **Backend**: Golang, Python, Ghidra (for decompiling the binaries), Docker.
- **AI**: Github Copilot, AI-based insights for code transformation.
- **Cloud Services**:  
  - Azure Functions
  - Azure Container Instances (ACI)
  - Azure Blob Storage

## Testing Instructions for the Judges

### Instructions to Run RecodeAI Locally
